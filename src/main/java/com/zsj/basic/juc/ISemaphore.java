/**
 * 计数信号量。从概念上讲，信号量维护一组许可。如有必要，每个{@link #acquire}都会阻止，直到获得许可证为止，然后再获取它。
 * 每个{@link #release}都会添加一个许可，可能会释放阻止获取者。 但是，没有使用实际的许可对象； {@code Semaphore}仅*保留可用数字的计数并采取相应措施。
 *
 * <p>信号量通常用于限制无法访问某些（物理或逻辑）资源的线程数。例如，这是一个使用信号量来控制对项目池的访问的类：
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Pool {
 *   private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
 *   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);
 *
 *   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
 *     available.acquire();
 *     return getNextAvailableItem();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void putItem(Object x) {
 *     if (markAsUnused(x))
 *       available.release();
 *   }
 *
 *   // Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo
 *
 *   protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
 *   protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];
 *
 *   protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
 *       if (!used[i]) {
 *          used[i] = true;
 *          return items[i];
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return null; // not reached
 *   }
 *
 *   protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
 *       if (item == items[i]) {
 *          if (used[i]) {
 *            used[i] = false;
 *            return true;
 *          } else
 *            return false;
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return false;
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>在获取项目之前，每个线程必须从信号灯获取许可，以确保该项目可供使用。当线程完成该项目后，它将返回到池，
 * 并向信号量返回一个允许，从而允许另一个线程获取该项目。请注意，在调用{@link #acquire}时，不保留任何同步锁，因为这将阻止返回到池中。
 * 信号量封装了限制访问池所需的同步，与维护池本身的一致性所需的任何同步分开。
 *
 * <p>信号灯初始化为1，并且使用的信号灯最多只有一个许可，可以用作互斥锁。这通常称为<em> binary信号量</em>，因为它只有两种状态：
 * 一个许可 可用，或零许可。以这种方式使用时，二进制信号量具有属性（与许多{@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}实现不同），
 * 该“锁”可以由线程（所有者除外）释放（因为信号量没有所有权的概念）。这在某些特殊情况下很有用，例如 死锁恢复。
 *
 * <p> 此类的构造方法可以选择接受<em>fairness</em>参数。设置为false时，此类不保证线程获得许可的顺序。
 * 特别是允许<em>插入</em>，也就是说，可以在正在等待的线程之前为调用{@link #acquire}的线程分配一个许可-从逻辑上讲，
 * 新线程将自己置于等待线程队列的头。当公平性设置为true时，信号量可确保选择调用任何{@link #acquire())获取}方法的线程，
 * 以处理这些方法的调用的顺序获得许可。 -先进先出； FIFO）。请注意，FIFO排序必定适用于这些方法中的特定内部执行点。
 * 因此，一个线程可能在另一个线程之前调用{@code #acquire}，但在另一个线程之后调用顺序点，并且类似地在从该方法返回时调用。
 * 还请注意，未定时的{@link #tryAcquire())tryAcquire}方法不遵守公平性设置，而是会使用所有可用的许可。
 *
 * <p>通常，用于控制资源访问的信号应初始化为公平的，以确保没有线程因访问资源而被饿死。当将信号量用于其他类型的同步控制时，
 * 不公平排序的吞吐量优势通常会超过公平考虑因素。
 *
 * <p>此类还提供了方便的方法来同时{@link #acquire() 获得}和{@link #release())发布}多个。当在不公平的情况下使用这些方法时，请当心不确定的延迟增加的风险。
 *

/**
 * <p>
 * 1、类Semaphore的构造函数permits 是许可的意思，代表同一时间，最多允许permits执行acquire() 和release() 之间的代码。
 * 2、方法{@link ISemaphore#acquire()} 的功能是每调用1次此方法，就消耗掉n个许可。
 * 3、方法{@link ISemaphore#release()} 的功能是每调用1次此方法，就动态添加n个许可。
 * 4、方法{@link ISemaphore#acquireUninterruptibly()} 作用是是等待进入acquire()方法的线程不允许被中断。
 * 5、方法{@link ISemaphore#availablePermits()} 返回Semaphore对象中当前可以用的许可数。
 * 6、方法{@link ISemaphore#drainPermits()} 获取并返回所有的许可个数，并且将可用的许可重置为0
 * 7、方法{@link ISemaphore#getQueueLength()} 的作用是取得等待的许可的线程个数
 * 8、方法{@link ISemaphore#hasQueuedThreads()}的作用是判断有没有线程在等待这个许可
 * 9、公平和非公平信号量：
 *      有些时候获取许可的的顺序与线程启动的顺序有关，这是的信号量就要分为公平和非公平的。
 *      所谓的公平信号量是获得锁的顺序与线程启动的顺序有关，但不代表100%获得信号量，仅仅是在概率上能保证，而非公平信号量就是无关的。
 * 10、方法{@link ISemaphore#tryAcquire()} 的作用是尝试获取1个许可。
 *      如果获取不到则返回false，通常与if语句结合使用，其具有无阻塞的特点。无阻塞的特点可以使不至于在同步处于一直持续等待的状态。
